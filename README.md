# Something_Like_Vuls_WebApp
Start by making an application to try to detect vulnerabilities and suggest solutions (like Vuls), written in Go
Then transition it to a webapp, where the backend is written in Go and the frontend is in HTML/CSS

Something Like Vuls 
Go Skills Practiced: Programming, Go Syntax, Golang best practices, Algorithms and Data Structures
Vuls is a cloud-based network security software based on Go. You can either use the existing Vuls code as a baseline for your project or replicate the source project yourself. The app is used for scanning software and searching for possible vulnerabilities. While it may not necessarily fix the problem, your project should be smart enough to suggest solutions to the user. 

Create a Web Application 
Go Skills Practiced: Programming, Algorithms and Data Structures, Go Syntax, Golang best practices
You can build and deploy a fully functional web application with Go. The Go server can be used for the backend of the application while CSS and HTML can be used for the front-end. The theme and niche of the website can be anything you want it to be from a regular static landing page to a dynamic web application.
